##### Relationships with People
**Influence**: You see yourself as someone who enjoys taking charge of people and leading a team. However, you are as happy as
most people to sell ideas and negotiate. This suggests that you are inclined to seek to influence people when you feel
it is appropriate. When it comes to expressing your views, you are less likely to express strong views than others and
you prefer to avoid criticising other people directly. Furthermore, you balance accepting group decisions with standing
by your own view.

**Sociability**: You are generally someone who is likely to strike a moderate balance between being quiet, reserved, sociable and
talkative. While you are as talkative as other people, you have less need to spend time in the company of others. You
feel about as comfortable as others when it comes to meeting new people or handling relatively formal situations.

**Empathy**: You are likely to have a strong interest in the welfare of colleagues and come across as someone who is prepared to
make allowances and provide support for people at work in times of personal crisis. In terms of making decisions, you
slightly prefer to consult other people first rather than making a decision without reference to others. However, you
appear to have a slight tendency to talk openly about your successes.

##### Thinking Style
**Analysis**: You very much enjoy working with facts and figures and analysing numerical information. You are very likely to spot
errors or difficulties in arguments, suggesting a critical approach to work. In addition, you are moderately interested in
the motives which underlie people's behaviour.

**Creativity and Change**: You describe yourself as extremely prepared to come up with new ways of looking at things or solving problems. This
is reinforced by your extreme preference for abstract concepts and for considering issues from a more theoretical
standpoint. You appear to have a slight preference for more radical and unorthodox approaches to tasks. You appear
to neither crave novelty and variety nor actively seek to maintain a consistent routine. In terms of flexibility of
approach, you are as likely as others to adapt your style to the situation or the people you are dealing with.

**Structure**: You are very strongly inclined to think ahead and make contingency plans should things go wrong. At the same time
you are strongly orientated towards the meticulous checking of detail and you are likely to be well organised and
prepared in most circumstances. You prefer to strike a balance between seeing deadlines as flexible and focusing on
getting tasks finished on time. You also describe yourself as neither sticking to rules rigidly nor consciously prepared
to break them.

##### Feelings and Emotions
**Emotion**: You may find you are moderately anxious, neither generally feeling particularly tense nor totally calm and collected on
a day-to-day basis. You also tend to remain fairly calm before important events. You tend to be a little more prepared
than others to put criticism in perspective or ignore it completely. In terms of optimism and pessimism your outlook is
more pronounced, as you tend to focus on the positive aspects of situations. When it comes to trusting people, you
are slightly more likely than other people to be cautious. You display your emotions and feelings at work as much as
other people.

**Energy and Drive**: You appear to be as active as most other people and are most comfortable when you are moderately busy. You like to
balance winning with taking part in activities for their own sake. You are likely to be very ambitious in your career and
you aim to reach the highest goals. You also are as likely to reach decisions as swiftly as most people
